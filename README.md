# Blog 

## Using Astro's Blog template to get a blog started from

This repo contains an experiment to put together a proto-blog.  I've tried to keep a blog for years, but with the advent of micro-blogging and my short attention span and multiple duties, I haven't been able to keep one up. 

Hopefully, by playing with this, it will help me get one started, then I can build a habit around keeping it up.  Not that anyone would necesarily want to read this, but that doesn't really matter anyway.
