Here's an Object-Oriented Programming problem using Class syntax. Try to solve it yourself before looking at the solution.

> Problem: Create a BankAccount class with properties balance and owner. The class should have methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount) that update the balance accordingly. The class should also have a method transfer(otherAccount, amount) that transfers the specified amount from the current account to the other account.

Here's my solution. It's pretty straightforward.

## My Solution

Make sure to include edge cases so that accounts are not overdrawn for withdrawals or transfers!

```javascript
/*
>Problem: Create a BankAccount class with properties balance and owner. The class should have methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount) that update the balance accordingly. The class should also have a method transfer(otherAccount, amount) that transfers the specified amount from the current account to the other account.
*/

//i: balance - number
//i: owner - string
//o: none returned, new instance of a BanKAccount

// declare class BankAccount, two params, balance and owner
class BankAccount {
  // in constructor - params balance and owner
  constructor(balance, owner) {
    // set this.balance to balance
    this.balance = balance;
    // set this.owner to owner
    this.owner = owner;
  }
  // outside constructor function, add three methods
  //delcare deposit method, takes one param amount - number
  deposit(amount) {
    // add amount to this.balance
    this.balance += amount;
  }
  //declare withdraw method, takes one param amount - number
  withdraw(amount) {
    // conditional to check if enough funds are present
    if (this.balance >= amount) {
      // subtract amount from this.balance
      this.balance -= amount;
    } else {
      console.log('insufficient funds');
    }
  }
  //declare transfer, two params, otherAccount - instance of a BankAccount object, amount, number
  transfer(otherAccount, amount) {
    // edge case to ensure that enough money is available to transfer
    if (this.balance >= amount) {
      //amount is subtracted from this.balance
      this.balance -= amount;
      //amount is added to otherAccount.balance
      otherAccount.balance += amount;
    } else {
      console.log('insufficient funds');
    }
  }
}
const boa = new BankAccount(1000, 'Mike Smith');
const wf = new BankAccount(1500, 'Sally Ride');

console.log(boa);
console.log(wf);

boa.transfer(wf, 500);

console.log(boa);
console.log(wf);

console.log(boa.withdraw(20000));

boa.transfer(wf, 20000);
```

And here's an alternate solution, generated by ChatGPT:

```javascript
class BankAccount {
  constructor(owner, balance) {
    this.owner = owner;
    this.balance = balance;
  }
  deposit(amount) {
    this.balance += amount;
  }
  withdraw(amount) {
    if (this.balance >= amount) {
      this.balance -= amount;
    } else {
      console.log('Insufficient funds.');
    }
  }
  transfer(otherAccount, amount) {
    if (this.balance >= amount) {
      this.withdraw(amount);
      otherAccount.deposit(amount);
    } else {
      console.log('Insufficient funds.');
    }
  }
}

let account1 = new BankAccount('Jane', 1000);
let account2 = new BankAccount('Bob', 500);
account1.transfer(account2, 250);
console.log(account1.balance); // 750
console.log(account2.balance); // 750
```
