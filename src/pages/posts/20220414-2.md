Although this blog is about JavaScript and web development, it would not be as interesting if there weren't some fun personal stuff added to it.  Also, I learn something new each time I try and make something different. 

Wanda is a labradoodle that we adopted in September of 2021.  She has a flat coat, giving her a distinctive appearance from the curly coat that is so popular.  We think she is beautful, but she is a bit of a mess because she does shed quite a bit and has a tendency to get stuff stuck in her beard.    

Most of our neighborhood knows her and it's fun to share her with the kids in the neighborhood.  

Here are some fun pictures of Wanda, enjoy!
