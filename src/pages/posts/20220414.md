Here's another fun JavaScript challenge from [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/mQunDaXMdXcC9r9xH).



> Given an input string, reverse the string word by word, the first word will be the last, and so on.
>
> Examples
>
>  reverseWords("hello   world!  ") ➞ "world! hello"
>
> reverseWords("a good example") ➞ "example good a"
>
>Notes:
> - A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
> - The input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should 
> not contain leading or trailing spaces.
> - You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
> - Try to solve this in linear time.


```javascript
const phrase1 ='hello   world!  '
const phrase2 ='  What a CRAZY WORLD!  '
const phrase3 ='a good example'

function reverseWords(string) {
 return string.split(' ').filter(space => space !== '').reverse().join(' ')
}

reverseWords(phrase1) // 'world! hello'
reverseWords(phrase2) // 'WORLD! CRAZY a What'
reverseWords(phrase3) // 'example good a'

// We can also shorten the function using arrow function syntax:

const reverseWords = (string) =>  
 string.split(' ').filter(space => space !== '').reverse().join(' ')

// And it will work the same way.

```

How does this work?  First, we use the [split](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split) method to split the string into an array of words.  Then, we use the [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) method to remove any empty strings from the array.  Next, we use the [reverse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reverse) method to reverse the array.  Finally, we use the [join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join) method to join the array back into a string.

Notice that by filtering out the original spaces we're able to remove any duplicates and also remove any leading or trailing spaces.  By passing in a spac to the join method, we're able to add the spaces between words.
