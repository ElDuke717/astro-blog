Here's another challenge from [Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/xKKwvL2zYC8pEvMLG) that I solved today.


    A leap year happens every four years, so it's a year that is perfectly divisible by four. 
    However, if the year is a multiple of 100 (1800, 1900, etc), the year must be divisible by 400.

    Write a function that determines if the year is a leap year or not.
    Examples

    leapYear(2020) ➞ true

    leapYear(2021) ➞ false

    leapYear(1968) ➞ true


This solution uses the [conditional (ternary) operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) to solve the problem.  It is concise and easy to understand.

```javascript
const year1 = 2020;
const year2 = 2021;
const year3 = 1600;
const year4 = 1700;

// arrow function using the ternary operator
const leapYearArrow = (year) => 
   year % 100 === 0 ? year % 400 === 0 : year % 4 === 0 


leapYearArrow(year1); 
leapYearArrow(year2);
leapYearArrow(year3);
leapYearArrow(year4);

```
First we have to test if the year is divisible by 100 as a first step to see if the year is a multiple of 100 and can be tested to see if it's divisible by 400.   If it's divisible 100 and 400, then it's a leap year.  If not, then we test to see if the year is divisble by 4.  If it is, then it's a leap year.  If not, then it's not a leap year.

Surprisingly, I tried to write this solution as a longer form [function declaration](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function) using [if...else](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) conditional logic and it was more difficult to figure out.  I will post that solution later, after I figure it out.
