## Counter
>Declare a function 'counter', which takes no arguments and returns another function. The returned function takes a number as an argument, and when invoked, it will return the sum of the number passed in and the number initially passed to the 'counter' function.


## numCount 

>Declare a function 'numCount', which takes in a single number as an argument and returns another function. The returned function takes a string as an argument, and when invoked, it will search that string for the number initially passed in to the 'numCount' function, and return the number of occurrences.
>Once complete, write some code to test your 'numCount' function.


## multiplier
>Declare a function 'multiplier', which takes a number as an argument and returns another function. The returned function takes another number as an argument, and when invoked, it will return the product of the two numbers passed in.


## getCounter
